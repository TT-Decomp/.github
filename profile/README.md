# TT-Decomp

**Telltale Decompilation (TT-Decomp)** is a reverse engineering initiative focused on decompiling and documenting the custom proprietary engine used by **Telltale Games**. Our current priority is understanding and reconstructing the internals of **Minecraft: Story Mode – Season 1 Complete Edition**, with an eye toward expanding into other Telltale titles as our knowledge and tooling grow.

---

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Our goals include:
- Decompiling game binaries to reconstruct original logic.
- Documenting engine systems, scripting VMs, file formats, and pipelines.
- Building a foundation for modding, restoration, and educational insight.
- Fostering an open, research-focused community.

---

## 📌 Current Focus: Minecraft Story Mode – Season 1

We are currently focused on the **Complete Edition of Minecraft: Story Mode – Season 1**, due to:
- Its representative use of Telltale's later engine builds.
- Its popularity and preservation importance.
- The diversity of assets and subsystems it includes.

### Why this version?
This edition consolidates all episodes into a single package, offering a comprehensive example of the engine in action, from scripting to assets to runtime behavior.

## 🔍 Scope of Work

- **Decompilation**
  - Analyzing executable binaries and virtual machines.
  - Reconstructing scripting logic from compiled `.luac` or bytecode.

- **Documentation**
  - File format specs (e.g., `.ttarch`, `.d3dtx`, `.landb`, etc.).
  - Engine features and toolchains.
  - Script VM internals and API surfaces.

- **Tools**
  - Asset extractors and converters.
  - Bytecode disassemblers and decompilers.
  - Visualization utilities.
